Narrative:
In order to check whether the parser is working properly
As a development team
I want to test the parser with certain conditions

Scenario: Only one player is given

Given a SAF file with value onePlayer.saf
When I parse the file
Then there should be a parse error

Scenario: a player is given with wrong a characteristic 

Given a SAF file with value wrongCharacteristic.saf
When I parse the file
Then there  should be a parse error


Scenario: Valid input is given

Given a SAF file with value validInput.saf
When I parse the file
Then the left player should be initialized
And the right player should be initialized
