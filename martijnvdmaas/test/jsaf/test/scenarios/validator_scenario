Narrative:
In order to check whether the given input is valid
As a developer
I want to test the validator against different invalid inputs

Scenario: a player is given with an incorrect characteristic 

Given a SAF file with value wrongCharacteristic.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain a characteristic error



Scenario: a player is given with an incorrect move 

Given a SAF file with value wrongMove.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain a move error



Scenario: a player is given with an incorrect attack 

Given a SAF file with value wrongAttack.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain an attack error



Scenario: a player is given with an incorrect condition 

Given a SAF file with value wrongCondition.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain a condition error



Scenario: a player is given without an always rule 

Given a SAF file with value noAlwaysRule.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain a hasnoalways error


Scenario: Valid input is given

Given a SAF file with value validInput.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain no errors

Scenario: a player is given all errors

Given a SAF file with value allWrongConstants.saf
When I parse the input
And I validate the file
Then the validator should contain all validator errors
