Narrative:
In order to check whether files are parsed properly
As a development team
I want to test the parser with certain conditions

Scenario: Only one player is given

Given a SAF fighter file with value onePlayer.saf
When I parse the file
Then there should be a parse error

Scenario: There is a syntax error in the input file

Given a SAF fighter file with value wrongSyntax.saf
When I parse the file
Then there should be a parse error

Scenario: Valid input is given

Given a SAF fighter file with value validInput.saf
When I parse the file
Then the left player should be initialized
And the right player should be initialized
