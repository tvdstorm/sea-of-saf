- I choose to add the characteristics of a fighter as Fighter instance variables instead
as a set of attributes since they have a default value and, because of that, have to be
defined anyway.

- Why do I have operatorws as objects in my AST? Is it better fit for the job then the
Composite Pattern?

- Okay, so I decided to implement the checker as a visitor. The thing that bothers me is
that I'm obstructed in using Throwable's, since the Visitor interface doens't describe them.
Now one can argue that if the Checker finds an inconsistency, it is normal behavior to report
it. One should use exception handling when the code is intermingled with the normal AST
constructing code, then it is exceptional behavior.
