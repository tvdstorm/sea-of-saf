GLOBAL:
-	All code is written with the basic guidelines of Java
-	The SAF package is divided in three packages: grammar, interpreter, and the safobjects
-	The java-code open and close brackets for functions, methods and loops are always positioned on a single line
-	Comments should be avoided unless the code needs a rationale

GRAMMAR: 
-	Each function must have an initializer: {}
-	The 'or' symbol | is always written at the beginning of the next line

SAFOBJECTS:
-	Each class must have a custom toString() function that will show the values of the instantiated object
-	The structure of the safobjects is the following: fields, constructors, class-specific methods, toString() method, getters and setters
